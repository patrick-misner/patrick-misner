## Bio

After over a decade of hard work in the IT world it is time for me to try something new. I have always enjoyed scripting and automation, working with databases and editing the open-source code I could for some projects in IT. 

In May of 2021 I enrolled in Boise Codeworks with hopes to kick off the beginning of a serious career change. I wanted to really push myself to learn the fundamentals and the modern architecture developers are using in the professional world. I am determined and excited to start working as a developer.



### Interests: 

🎸 - Playing music, I have played guitar and bass and toured the NW in several bands. </br>
🛩 - FPV (first-person-view camera) drones and planes. I have crashed and recovered a plane several miles from launch. </br>
