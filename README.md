## Bio

After over a decade of hard work in the world of IT support, I embarked on a journey to embrace new challenges. I find joy in creating and optimizing processes, scripting, automation, and diving into databases. I've always been eager to tinker with open-source code for various IT projects.

In May 2022, I enrolled in Boise Codeworks to strengthen my foundations and immerse myself in the modern architecture developers use in the professional world. I am determined and excited to leverage my experience and knowledge to contribute as an IT support/administration specialist or a software developer.
