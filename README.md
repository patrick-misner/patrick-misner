## Bio
With over a decade of dedicated experience in IT support, I have developed a deep passion for creating and optimizing processes, solving technical problems and documenting solutions and configurations.

I am eager to continue building on this extensive background and to apply my skills in IT support, administration, or other technology related roles. I am committed to contributing effectively and growing within the IT field for the long term, bringing a wealth of practical knowledge and a proactive mindset to any opportunity.
