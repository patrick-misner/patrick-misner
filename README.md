After over a decade of hard work in the IT world it is time for me to try something new. I have always enjoyed scripting and automation, working with databases and editing the open-source code I could for some projects in IT. In May of 2021 I started attending Boise Codeworks in hopes to kick off the beginning of a serious career change. I wanted to really push myself to learn the fundamentals and the modern architecture developers are using in the professional world. I am incredibly excited to start working in a new career.
